###Greetings to all PHP developers!
>
My absolute Free Windows PHP-server (GO language) for PHP-developers on OctoberCMS (Caddy server + PHP7 in FastCGI mode + OctoberCMS & Sqlite for storage this CMS + free admins components). 
>
Very easy to configure and allows you to deploy your development environment in literally 1 minute. SQLite allows for small projects to transfer the source code to the production server without unnecessary gestures.
>
Assembly can also be used in production. Includes components:
- My server (base on Caddy server sources)
- PHP 7.1.1
- 2 utilities from the winginx project (hostseditor.exe and php-config.exe)
 - HeidiSQL for MySQL, PostgreSQL, Miqrosoft SQL Server administration
- SQLite Administrator
- WinSCP for remote SSH
- Sendmail dummy for debugging the sending of emails
>
In the plans:
- Embedding the Mysql engine directly into the code (without installing the latter);
- Adding additional administration tools
- Full automatization: auto backup, auto deploy on work server, git, and more more (depending on the interest of users)
>
Download archive: https://caddywps.linkonoid.com/download
or https://sourceforge.net/projects/caddywps
>
At the code are no viruses and bookmarks !!!
>
Installation - not required: extract archive and just run caddywps.exe!!! To go to the OctoberCMS Admin Panel select the top item of the program menu from the tray (admin/admin) or new installation.
>
!!!In some cases (if not), use the hostseditor.exe utility (also launched from the tray menu) to register localhost (127.0.0.1) in the hosts file. Successful work!
